##  Description
This repository was created for personal familiarization with the playwright and playwright-stealth tools. Previously, I dealt with Beautiful Soup and Selenium, the development of which libraries began back in ~2004. Therefore, I think it's worth taking a look at the newer playwright library, taking into account the recommendations of colleagues on various forums.

Here we scrape a documentation site. You can substitute your link and see the result. The script is written without "stealth" because there is no captcha or anything like that.
